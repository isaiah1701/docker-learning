    <h1>Your Visit Count: {{ count }}</h1>
    <p>This visit is powered by a full multi-container Docker app I built from scratch. Here's how I did it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Containers 🧱</strong> – I learned that each service (Flask, Redis, NGINX) runs inside its own isolated container. They act like lightweight, self-contained virtual machines.</li>

      <li><strong>Dockerfile 📦</strong> – I used a Dockerfile to build an image for my Flask app. It defines exactly what environment, packages, and code are needed to run it.</li>

      <li><strong>Docker Image → Container 🚀</strong> – The image is like a blueprint. When you run it, Docker creates a live container that can serve traffic, process requests, or connect to other services.</li>

      <li><strong>Docker Network 🌐</strong> – I learned that services can talk to each other using Docker’s internal network. My Flask app connects to Redis using the container name as a hostname — no IPs needed.</li>

      <li><strong>docker-compose.yml 🧩</strong> – I stitched everything together with one file. This composer file lets me define all services (web, redis, nginx) and how they interact — including volumes and networks.</li>

      <li><strong>Flask 🔥</strong> – The Flask app runs in each container and increments the visit count. Each container runs the same code, but they all share data via Redis.</li>

      <li><strong>Redis 🧠</strong> – Redis acts like memory shared between containers. Every time you visit this page, a counter stored in Redis is updated.</li>

      <li><strong>NGINX 🚦</strong> – I added NGINX as a reverse proxy. It handles incoming traffic and load balances it across multiple Flask containers, so no single container gets overwhelmed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This wasn’t just a visit counter — it was a crash course in modern DevOps practices, and now I can say I’ve built and scaled a multi-service containerized app from scratch.</p>
